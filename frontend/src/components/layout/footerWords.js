    <h2>Returns and Refunds</h2>
    We want you to be satisfied with every purchase you make. If an item you purchased arrived broken, is faulty or isn't what you had in mind, we're here to help, subject to the below terms.

This policy forms part of the Photon Terms and Conditions. Photon is committed to operate Photon’s business in terms of the Consumer Protection Act and all policies are subject to the applicable law

We will refund or exchange most goods if you return them within 14 days of purchase, provided:
it is in its original packaging and condition, including all attachments, accessories and documentation;
it is unused
Returns and exchange requests for items purchased more than 14 days ago might incur collection, delivery and processing fees. However, goods that show a manufacturing defect within the first 6 months of purchase will be repaired, replaced or refunded at no cost to you.

If you purchased these goods on your own Photon card you don’t need to provide your original invoice, Photon will find it for you.
Refunds
Once Photon have assessed a returned item and approved a refund, you will receive your money back in the same manner in which you purchased it from Photon:
Credit note
Electronic transfer directly into your account (10 to 20 working days due to COVID19 disruptions)
Cash (if the original payment was made in cash)
Credit card (by reversal back to your credit card and subject to banking delays)
Cheque – within one week of request and only once your original cheque is cleared.
Photon will refund a purchase for the exact amount paid less the following:
Credit note,
any delivery costs already incurred by Photon,
any restocking fee for special orders
Products may be returned  Photon can help you to arrange a third party courier by calling +263 775 639 338 . The courier service will be charged at the going rate for your area and Product specifications. Please note that it may not be possible to determine in-store whether goods have been damaged or what the cause of a failure or defect may be. This is of importance as it determines whether the goods may be repaired, replaced or refunded. Accordingly, Photon reserve the right to refer returned goods for technical assessment by the manufacturer or authorised service centre prior to repairing, replacing or refunding and to provide you with feedback within 15 working days of receipt of the returned goods and to act accordingly. Photon may arrange for the assessment to take place at your home in the case of large appliances.

If your goods show a defect after the initial 6 month period, but still within the manufacturer’s warranty period, Photon will send the goods to the manufacturer for repair and the manufacturer will decide whether you have a valid claim and if so, whether they will repair or replace. If the goods become defective once the manufacturer’s warranty has expired, Photon can arrange with the manufacturer or its agents to repair them. No repairs will be done without you approving a quotation first.

Should an item be damaged or defective, please contact Photon’s Customer Support Centre on +263 775 639338 immediately to arrange for the earliest convenient collection date. Please make a note on the delivery waybill of damages as well. Once returned to the store, the Product will undergo an assessment following which a decision be made on the replacement of the item. Promotional free or bundled items that were part of a purchase must also be returned.
