Photon delivers from Monday to Friday, 08h00 till 17h00 and does not deliver on a Saturday, Sunday and any Zimbabwean public holiday. Items are delivered in 3 (three) to 5 (five) working days if there are no unexpected delays. Should it be unavoidable for us to exceed these delivery times, you will be notified either telephonically or electronically.
    
    Photon delivers to registered customers within certain specified delivery areas. Deliveries to outlying areas shall attract an additional charge that will be calculated after checkout(usually a flat $15). An outlying area refers to a suburb or town that falls out of any regional town/city or main centre. Outlying areas include farms, mines and townships.
    
    On delivery of the order to the specified delivery address, you will receive Photon’s delivery note showing the items delivered. For verification purposes, the person accepting delivery at the delivery address will be required to produce a form of identification. Any person other than yourself who receives the Products at the delivery address is presumed to be authorised to accept delivery on your behalf. Should no-one be in attendance at the delivery address specified by you at the time of delivery, the driver will return the Products and leave a notice at the delivery address to that effect. The courier company will attempt to contact you to make new arrangements for delivery. Photon reserves the right to charge an additional delivery fee should it be required under these circumstances. Our sole liability for failing to deliver the Products timeously is limited to delivery being effected at a later agreed time at no additional charge.
    
     
    Please arrange that you or your authorised representative, who is a responsible person, is available to accept your purchases at the delivery address and that appropriate access will be made available. On delivery, Photon will require you or your authorised representative to sign and print your or their name on a duplicate copy of the delivery note, to confirm receipt. Photon have outsourced all deliveries and accordingly, cannot, to the extent permitted by law, be liable for any damage suffered or loss incurred by reason of any acts or omissions of the courier.
    
    <h3>Delivery Confirmation</h3>
    Photon will indicate its acceptance of your order by delivering the products to you or allowing you to collect them, and only at that point will a contract between you and Photon be completed. This is regardless of any communication from Photon stating that your order or payment has been confirmed. Photon will indicate its rejection of your order by cancelling it and, as soon as possible thereafter, refunding you for any amount already paid. Any products or services on the same order which have not been dispatched/delivered to you will not form part of that the contract between you and Photon. Delivery dates are estimates only, and as we process your order we will inform you if any products or services on your order turn out to be unavailable or delayed for any reason.
